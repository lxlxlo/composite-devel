>Ok, you've just downloaded the latest version of Hydrogen and have it installed successfully. Now you want to test it while creating your favourite song, this might help you to learn it, writing down a few difficult parts in order to play them over and over again or to be sure that in future a quick glance at the songfile will bring up immediately to mind the song. Hydrogen can be used also as an advanced <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"click"</SPAN
> machine that can help you practicing (in speed, precision and rudiments), maybe with a custom pattern designed by yourself. This short introduction will guide you creating a a complete song, we will work on "Georgy Porgy" of Toto which has a quite straight structure therefore is appropriate for a guide but this doenst mean the song is _actually_ easy to write down since the drummer (Jeff Porcaro) enriches the groove with his personal touch and fantasy; Hydrogen will not play better than the drummer who is working on the song, most of the task must be accomplished by the programmer's sensibility and experience.</P

>The base pattern (Fig. 1 and 2) is 4 bars long (divided in 2 different bars, each repeated 2 times, so it's [2a*2]+[2b*2]) and lasts for the whole song, from the beginning to the end, riff included; most of the time (intro and riff excluded) this base pattern is repeated 2 times to reach the commonly used 8 bars for each part of the song (A,B,C). Before starting let's set the speed to 98bpm (HINT HINT you can find out by yourself the speed of the song while playing it with your favourite media player and following the rhythm by clicking repeatedly the backslash key in Hydrogen) and from the menu <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Grid Resolution"</SPAN
> let's set '16'. To create a new pattern select the instrument <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Closed HH"</SPAN
>, click on RMB and choose <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Fill Notes"</SPAN
>: the first two bars will be filled up. Then insert manually the beats on Snare Jazz and Kick as indicated in the 2 pictures below and there we have the base pattern for our song. Note how the beats on the hi-hat have different 'hardness': beats falling on the beginning of the bar are set at [0.78], the others at [0.50] (you can check that on the lower stat bar of Hydrogen), in order to give groove the song.</P

		<P

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"intro_a"</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C_1"</SPAN

CLASS="bold"
><B
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>Pay attention</B
></SPAN
>, why can't we just add 2 more 'X' next to this pattern? Because in the first bar there is a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Crash"</SPAN
> beat which ends the previous intro, therefore the two bars are not completely equal; you have to copy the pattern <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C_1"</SPAN
> and rename it to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C_2"</SPAN
>, cutting the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

>
		
		<P
>Same thing for the following 2 bars: just copy into the Song Editor the pattern in Fig. 2, rename it according to the previous ones and add two 'X' (because they're identical), you should reach number '8' as shown in Fig. 4.</P
>
		<P
>The 4 remaining bars of the verse are more or less the same of what we've just written, so why redo everything from scratch? Bars number 5,6,7 are virtually identical to the previous ones so we just have to add 2 crosses to pattern <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C_2"</SPAN
> and one to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C_3+4"</SPAN
> taking care of renaming the patterns logically (so to understand how the song moves around the Song Editor), while in the eighth bar there is a fill which closes the verse. We have to copy+paste in a new line a pattern already written (ex. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C_3+4"</SPAN
>), rename it to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C_8"</SPAN
> and modify it as in Fig. 4. Note how in this case too the three <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Snare Jazz"</SPAN
> beats on fourth bar have hardness properly tuned with [0.10], [0.20] and [0.78]; you can't see it in the picture but also the two final beats of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Tom Mid"</SPAN
> are both 'touched' to [0.50], after all it's only just a small fill, better not beat hard on the drums :)</P

		<P
>Now that we're done with the first verse you should have an idea of how the whole thing works: the first bridge is made of the same 8 bars (4+4) with a slight change at the end of the fourth, which forces us to create a 'custom' fourth bar while the others are easily added with our friendly little cross ('X').</P
>
		
		<P
>Let's take the latest pattern created as sample (<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C_8"</SPAN
>), let's copy and rename it to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Bridge1_4"</SPAN
> (i.e. fourth bar of first bridge) and modify it as in Fig. 6. We have quickly completed the bridge! The Song Editor now should appear as follows in Fig. 7. Looking closely one should ask why the fifth bar of the bridge (17th bar of the whole song) isnt assigned to the pattern <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C_1"</SPAN
>; the answer is that the pattern has also a <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Crash"</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"

	<P
>Now we can build up quickly the remaining parts of the song: after this bridge there is another verse, then a bridge and a chorus, which are mostly the same so we just need to create different pattern in a few cases (along with this guide you will find the song file with the whole song). Of course one can write as many lines in the Song Editor as the bars in the song but a whole song would become difficult to follow, plus the songfile would be bigger.</P

		<P
>In this riff the drums play the same pattern we already know for one bar (see Fig. 1) while in the second bar only beats two times (Fig. 8), then the pattern again and then again two beats with a small final fill (Fig. 9); again the open hi-hat is done with beats of different intensity: [0.78] and [0.20].</P

		<P
>After the riff we have half job done. We just have to write down two verses, one bridge, a chorus repeated 3 times and the same riff at the end.</P
>
		
		<P
>The second part of the song is slightly different from the previous one because we have a few hi-hat opening during the verses and every 4 bars there's a small fill almost everytime: it's easier to start from scratch a new set of pattern (i.e. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C-*"</SPAN
>) in the Song Editor copying them with a suffix like '_hh' to show the presence of the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Open HH"</SPAN
>. As noted in the introduction of this guide, Jeff Porcaro puts much of his skills playing the song and this makes the difference between a song played from a raw and "cold" transcription on paper (or on Hydrogen): therefore the following parts of the song will try to be faithful to the original piece, but another 'ear' could give another written layout of the same part: after all this doesnt matter so much since we are showing how a program works, not to play like Porcaro :)</P

		<P
>In Fig. 10 here is how is the section in the Song Editor of the two verses and the bridge following the first riff; as you can see the first bars (48-50 according to the Song Editor's enumeration) are already written before while the others (51-71) are new. Moreover there a few pattern 'ad hoc' identified by <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C-3a_hh"</SPAN

CLASS="QUOTE"
>"A-B-C-4a_hh"</SPAN

	<P

The goal of this little tutorial is giving a quick overview of the most common functions of Hydrogen: this piece of software can also run for other purposes, like an advanced 'click' played with the drum, or to loop playing some part of a song difficult to catch; however, as in other things, analyzing the song itself helps the comprehension and here too, Hydrogen can be helpful reducing the time needed to write down a pattern and tune it.</P
