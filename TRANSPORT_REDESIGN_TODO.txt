TO-DO LIST FOR TRANSPORT REDESIGN
=================================
2009-04-27

INLINE TODO MARKERS
-------------------

While coding, these are the markers used for "FIX ME LATER":

    #warning "SOME MESSAGE ABOUT FIXING THIS LATER"

    assert(false)

    // TODO: some message

    /* TODO: some message
     */

As of this writing (2009-05-25), the status is:

    #warning:       13 locations
    assert(false):   6 locations
    TODO comment:   19 locations

SPECIFIC TASKS
--------------

(.) Implement support for audio sample rate (currently
    hard-coded to 48000 Hz).

(.) Get pattern mode and the "loop" setting working.
    Currently, things are hard-coded to loop a song.

(.) At beginning of a song, the "Rewind" button causes
    a crash.  At the end of a song, "Fast-Forward"
    causes a crash.

(.) Re-implement Pattern mode with new transport.  This is
    what hydrogen.cpp lacks to compile.  (Update 2009-04-28:
    pattern mode added, but realized late that I also need
    a "stacked" pattern mode... which still needs to be
    implemented.)  (Update 2009-04-29:  The stuff was
    implemented, but not tested as of yet.)

(.) Create unit tests for as many classes as possible.

(.) Re-implement randomization logic (do this in
    hydrogen.cpp:audioEngine_song_sequence_process())
    This includes humanization, random pitch, lead/lag, etc.

(.) Implement a loop counter in TransportPosition.  The running
    clock in the UI will probably want this.

(.) Implement the Song->Jack Transport mapping in JackTimeMaster.

(.) Integrate songhelpers.cpp into H2Core::Song.

(.) Delete this file when all the tasks are complete.  :-)
