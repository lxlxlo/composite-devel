TO-DO LIST FOR TRANSPORT REDESIGN
=================================
2009-04-27

INLINE TODO MARKERS
-------------------

While coding, these are the markers used for "FIX ME LATER":

    #warning "SOME MESSAGE ABOUT FIXING THIS LATER"

    assert(false)

    // TODO: some message

    /* TODO: some message
     */

As of this writing (2009-04-27), the status is:

    #warning:       18 locations
    assert(false):  31 locations
    TODO comment:   10 locations

SPECIFIC TASKS
--------------

(.) Re-implement Pattern mode with new transport.  This is
    what hydrogen.cpp lacks to compile.  (Update 2009-04-28:
    pattern mode added, but realized late that I also need
    a "stacked" pattern mode... which still needs to be
    implemented.)

(.) After Hydrogen compiles, start creating unit tests to
    audit the behavior of all the classes (especially the
    new ones).  Do this before even writing SeqScript.
    ("Write your tests first.")

(.) Implement SeqScript and SeqScriptIterator

(.) Re-implement randomization logic (do this in
    hydrogen.cpp:audioEngine_song_sequence_process())
    This includes humanization, random pitch, lead/lag, etc.

(.) audioEngine_song_sequence_process() needs its own class,
    this will expecially be evident when it starts having
    subroutines, cursors, state variables, etc.

(.) Implement a loop counter in TransportPosition.  The running
    clock in the UI will probably want this.

(.) Implement the Song->Jack Transport mapping in JackTimeMaster.

(.) Integrate songhelpers.cpp into H2Core::Song.

(.) Delete this file when all the tasks are complete.  :-)
