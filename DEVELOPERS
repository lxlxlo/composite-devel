DEVELOPER INFO
==============

MAKING A RELEASE
----------------

Transitioning the code to remove some of the development hooks in
order to make a release has several, easy-to-forget steps.  They are:

  1. Remove the developer hook for 'version':

     a. Near the end of SConstruct, where it has 'extra_version',
        remove that.

     b. If you are bumping the revision, also do that in SConstruct.

     c. Update ChangeLog (and linux/debian/changelog if it's not
        symlinked)

     d. composite.desktop and linux/composite.desktop has a version
        in it that should be updated.

  2. Remove the 'developer warning': in data/composite.default.conf
     change hydrogen_preferences/showDevelWarning to "false".

  3. Make sure the manuals and translations are up-to-date in data/doc
     (i.e. regenerate HTML).  Make sure that data/doc/manual.html
     points to any new translations that have been contributed.

  4. Commit your changes to trunk.

  5. Make a tarball of the release (gzipped).  Use gzip instead of
     bzip2 for the folks on Windows.  Tarballs should be named:
                   
                    +--- Relese version
                    |
                    |    +--- Extra release version info
                  __|__ _|_
        composite-0.001-rc2.tar.gz

  6. If this is an RC release, the following steps are optional.

  7. In a clean directory, test build the tarball in as many ways as
     you can.  Call your friends.  Have a party.  Be sure to build
     packages on as many systems as possible.  Be sure to install
     and uninstall them, too.

  8. Go ahead and build binary packages.  Follow the naming convention
     for the platform that you're building for.

       Linux:    composite_0.000rc2_distro_arch.pkg
                 distro:  the GNU/Linux distro (e.g. 'lenny' for Debian)
                 arch:    the processor it's built for (e.g. i686)
                 pkg:     the package management system (deb, rpm)
       OS X:     composite_0.000rc2_arch.dmg
                 (arch is optional if the binary will work on both.)
       Windows:  composite_0.000rc2.exe

  9. At this time, Gabriel Beddingfield is doing all the tagging.
     Tags should be cryptographically signed.

  10. Make announcements.

CODING CONVENTIONS
------------------

Use 'stroustrup' indention.  (i.e. 4 spaces) Allow a little extra
space within parentheses, but don't go overboard.  Like this:

     while( (!done) || (five>six) ) {
         foo();
     }

And not like this:

     while ( ( ! done ) || ( five > six ) )
         {
             foo ( ) ;
         }
     }

Lines should /not/ exceed 80 columns... unless you have a really good
reason.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Use Doxygen formatting.  Place the documentation with the
/implementation/, and not necc. in the headers.
