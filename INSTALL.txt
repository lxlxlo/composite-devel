1. System Requirements
----------------------

Composite is supported on the following operating systems:

  * Linux/Unix/BSD
  * Mac OS X

Composite is *not* supported on Windows because there are currently no
Windows developers on the project... and so the Windows components
have fallen into disrepair.

Composite is known to work well on fairly old systems like this (as of
2009):

  Pentium III 500 MHz
  198 MB RAM
  Consumer-Grade (cheap) audio card
  Keyboard and Mouse
  1x1 USB MIDI Interface (optional)

2. Download
-----------

Composite can be downloaded as a binary package, source distribution,
or you can check out the current development version with Subversion.
These can be accessed on the Composite home page:

	http://gabe.is-a-geek.org/composite/

The source code for the current development version can be checked out
via Git:

	$ git clone git://gitorious.org/composite/composite.git

3. Binary Packages
------------------

GNU/Linux:

	Check your package management system for the package
	'composite.'  At this time there are no known distros
	that have a package for Composite.

Mac OS X:

	There are currently no Composite devs on OS X, so
	neither are there any binary packages.

4. Prerequisites to Build from Source
-------------------------------------

In order to build from source, you will need the following libraries
installed on your system, and the development header files:

	REQUIRED
	* Qt 4 Library (>=4.4.0, 4.3.x might work, 4.2.x won't)
	* Qt 4 SDK (moc, uic, etc.)
	* GNU g++ compiler (>=4.0, 3.x might work)
	* scons (>=0.98, 1.0 preferred, <0.98 might work)
	* libsndfile >=1.0.17
	* zlib and libtar -OR- libarchive
	  OS X: You will probably need to build libarchive from source.
	* At least 1 audio and 1 midi driver
	* OS X: Xcode

	DRIVERS AVAILABLE
	* JACK Audio Connection Kit (>=0.103.0)

	OPTIONAL SUPPORT
	* LASH (Linux Audio Session Handler)
	* libFLAC for handling FLAC sound files.
	* liblrdf for LADSPA plugins

On a single, 500MHz processor Composite takes about 1.5 hours to build.

5. Build and Install from Source
--------------------------------

After you have all the prerequisites, building and installing will
look like this:

	$ tar xjf composite-0.9.4.tar.bz2
	$ cd composite-0.9.4
	$ scons
	$ sudo scons install

If you wish to configure features like LADSPA plugins, FLAC support,
or debugging symbols, get more information like this:

	$ scons --help

To change the directory where scons is installed, it is done like
this:

	$ scons prefix=/path/to/install/dir
	$ sudo scons install

Uninstalling Composite is done like this:

	$ sudo scons -c install

Note that scons is a build system and not a package manager.  While we
make every effort to ensure that Composite uninstalls cleanly, it is
not a guarantee.

Composite uses a scons tool that detects the correct Qt settings, but
sometimes it needs a little help.  If Composite fails to build
(typically when a .ui file fails), set the Qt 4 install directory like
this:

	$ QTDIR=/opt/lib/qt4 scons

It's also best to ensure that your PATH is pointing to the Qt 4
versions of moc and uic, and not the Qt 3 versions.

___CREATING A BINARY PACKAGE___

If you are a package maintainer and wish for your packaging scripts to
be included in the Composite source tree, we would be happy to work
with you.  Please contact the developer mailing list (see the Composite
home page).  The instructions below are for the package systems that
have been contributed so far.

___CREATING A .DEB PACKAGE___

In order to create a .deb package for Debian or Debian-based systems
(like Ubuntu), you first need the debhelper package:

	# apt-get install debhelper

To build the Composite package:

	$ tar xjf composite-0.9.4.tar
	$ cd composite-0.9.4
	$ cd linux
	$ fakeroot dpkg-buildpackage

This will place the .deb package and description files in the parent
directory.  If you wish to change the version number for the archive,
edit linux/debian/changelog to set the version.
